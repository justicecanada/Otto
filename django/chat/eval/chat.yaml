  # Generic question that should work, even though it is "fact-seeking."
  history:
  - user: "What is the meaning of life?"
  responses:
  - The meaning of life is one of those eternal questions that people have pondered for centuries. Philosophers, theologians, and thinkers from various cultures and backgrounds have proposed countless interpretations. Some believe that the meaning of life is to seek happiness and fulfillment, while others argue for the pursuit of knowledge, love, or spiritual enlightenment. Some see life's meaning as inherently subjective, something each individual must determine for themselves. Ultimately, it's a deeply personal question, and the answer may vary from person to person.
