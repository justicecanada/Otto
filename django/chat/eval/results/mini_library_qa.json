An employee may be granted leave with pay in circumstances such as duties with a volunteer fire brigade, service with a volunteer reserve squad or when conscripted for fighting forest fires;\n\n\\- Adverse weather conditions prevent the employee from travelling to the workplace, and the employee has not contributed significantly to the circumstances that prevent travel to the workplace;\n\n\\- Environmental conditions in the workplace such as lack of heat could warrant the granting of time off with pay;\n\n\\- Spouses who are relocating may be granted other leave with pay to accompany their spouse or common-law partners during relocation activities (House Hunting Trip, Packing, Unpacking);", "{'title': \"Manager's Leave Guide: Effective Decision-Making & Administration\", 'source_name': 'https://jusnet.justice.gc.ca/eng/benefit-avantage/doc/lgm-gcpg-eng.pdf', 'reference_url': 'https://jusnet.justice.gc.ca/eng/benefit-avantage/doc/lgm-gcpg-eng.pdf'}\n4.4 Court Leave (Code 610)\n\nThe intent is to allow an employee leave with pay to comply with a subpoena or summons issued by a court or duly constituted body or representative of the legal process. Court leave is not granted to an employee who is a plaintiff or a defendant in a proceeding. Jury duty is also part of this provision, and is applicable for only that time during which an employee is required to be in court.\n\n13\n\nIf the employee satisfies the conditions of eligibility under the relevant collective agreement article, the leave shall be approved. A request for supporting documentation is recommended. This leave is not to be used for the employee's own court case (even if asked to be a witness).\n\n4.5 Examination Leave (Code 620)\n\nThis type of leave may be granted for the purpose of writing an examination (not for selection processes within the Public Service- see Personnel Selection Leave), which takes place during the employee's scheduled hours of work and where the course is directly related to the employee's duties or will improve the employee's qualifications.\n\nExamples would include university or college course exams, apprenticeship exams, defense of dissertations etc.\n\nThe granting of this leave is discretionary in nature.\n\n4.6 Family Related Responsibilities\n\n(Codes 410 to 490)\n\nThe intent is to provide for periods of leave for various family-related responsibilities.\n\nIncluded is the temporary care of a sick member of the employee's family as defined in the respective collective agreement, needs related to the adoption of a child, to the birth of a child, and the time required to take a family member to appointments.\n\nThis leave is tabulated in hours and must not exceed the entitlement identified within the employees' relevant collective agreement.\n\nManagers must examine the language of the collective agreement to determine if the appropriate code has been used by the employee when requesting leave. Collective agreements vary in what has been negotiated between the Employer and the bargaining agent. Some codes are not allowed to be used by some employees of bargaining groups.\n\n14\n\nFor those collective agreements with enabling language, the total hours which may be used for codes 470, 471 and 472 is 7.5 hours.\n\n\\- Groups providing for codes 470 to 472 include: AV, CS, EB, LP, PA, RE, TC\n\n\\- Groups not providing for codes 470 to 472 include: EC, FI\n\nAn employee who has used the maximum 7.5 hours under codes 470 to 472, or an employee not entitled to these codes, may not use another 400 series code to cover an absence normally covered by one of these codes. Another leave type must be used such as vacation, special vacation, personal, volunteer or compensatory leave.\n\nCode 490 \"other\" may only be used where the collective agreement has a provision providing for family related leave for other reasons. If the collective agreement does not provide enabling language for other reasons, the request must be denied.\n\nThe family member's relationship to the employee should be cited in the comments section of the application (example: son, daughter, spouse).\n\nEmployees should indicate the article (and sub-article) of the collective agreement under which they are applying in the remarks section of the leave application (whether in Leave Self-Service or on a paper leave form).\n\nCiting the article and sub-clause of the collective agreement demonstrates that the employee has referred to the collective agreement and facilitates the manager's ability to do the same.\n\n4.7 Injury on Duty Leave (Codes 660)\n\nAll employees subject to a collective agreement or Terms and Conditions of Employment are eligible for Injury on Duty Leave as per the Treasury Board Secretariat Injury-on-Duty Leave Policy. Casuals and Students are not entitled to paid injury on duty leave. In the case of students, they are not covered by the Government Employee's Compensation Act. Prior to hiring a student, managers must consult the Terms and Conditions of Employment for students.\n\nNote: Articling Students are covered by the LP collective agreement. A student studying law is covered by the Terms and Conditions of Employment for students.\n\nThis type of leave is automatically granted to employees who are away from the workplace due to a work related illness or injury when a claim has been made and\n\n15\n\napproved by the relevant Worker's Compensation authority. All related forms are processed by the department's Health and Safety Division which transmits documents to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). ESDC then transmits documents to the relevant provincial agency.\n\nThe relevant Worker's Compensation authority is the employee's province of work, even if the accident occurs while on travel status to another province.\n\nFederal Employees are governed by the Government Employees Compensation Act in the matter of work related illness or injury. All accidents must be reported to departmental authorities within three business days.\n\nManagers and supervisors are to consult the department's Health and Safety Division as soon as it is known an accident has occurred even in situations where the employee believes it is a minor incident.", "{'title': \"Manager's Leave Guide: Effective Decision-Making & Administration\", 'source_name': 'https://jusnet.justice.gc.ca/eng/benefit-avantage/doc/lgm-gcpg-eng.pdf', 'reference_url': 'https://jusnet.justice.gc.ca/eng/benefit-avantage/doc/lgm-gcpg-eng.pdf'}\nMost collective agreements provide for a maternity allowance to be paid out to supplement Employment Insurance (EI) or Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) benefits to supplement employment insurance payments.\n\nConsideration\n\nWhen requested, the leave must be approved. There is no discretion to deny such requests. Normally when employees state that they are pregnant, that is sufficient. In very unusual circumstances, a certificate or letter signed by a recognized medical authority may be requested.\n\nEmployees must provide at least four weeks advance notice.\n\n5.4 Other Leave Without Pay (Code 999)\n\n32\n\nOther Leave Without Pay is a catch-all for situations where a specific leave provision does not already provide a benefit in the collective agreement or Terms and Conditions of Employment.\n\nManagers are to use their discretion in granting these types of leave which are not meant to supplement any other type of leave that is already covered by a collective agreement or Terms and Conditions of Employment.\n\nFor example, if an employee has already benefited from the provisions for personal leave without pay and the absence requested is clearly for personal reasons, \"other\" leave without pay may not be granted.\n\nConsulting with your Labour Relations Advisor is strongly advised before approving this type of leave.\n\nThe following are a few examples of Leave without Pay for Other Reasons:\n\nPolitical Activities\n\nThe PSC will grant permission and leave without pay (LWOP) if it is satisfied that seeking nomination as or being a candidate will not impair, or be perceived as impairing, the employee's ability to perform his or her duties in a politically impartial manner. If the employee is declared elected in a provincial, territorial or federal election, he or she immediately ceases to be an employee of the Public Service. If the employee is elected into office for a municipal election, the PSC has the discretion to either grant the employee a leave of absence without pay, if requested, or require the employee to cease being an employee. Depending on the circumstances, the PSC may also allow the employee to remain in his or her position as a public servant.\n\nEmployment as Minister's Staff\n\nAcceptance of employment in the office of a minister, a minister of State, a secretary of State, or a member of Parliament): Upon request from a person appointed to the core public administration for Leave Without Pay to accept employment in the office of a minister, a minister of State, a secretary of State, or member of Parliament, the delegated authority may grant leave without pay for other reasons for this purpose. The person with the delegated authority may grant Leave Without Pay for other reasons for this purpose with the understanding that all the requirements with respect to leave without pay established in Appendix B of the TBS Directive on Leave and Special Working Arrangements are applicable. More detailed information can be found in this Directive.\n\n33\n\nPlease note there may be other situations which may be suitable such as when an employee's services are requested by an employer outside the PS for a fixed term under circumstances that will serve national interests.\n\n5.5 Parental Leave\n\nThis leave may be taken by either parent for the care and custody of either a newborn or adopted child for a maximum period of 37 weeks within the 52 week period beginning the day the child is born or the day on which the child comes into the employee's care.\n\nParental leave taken by a couple employed in the Public Service shall not exceed a total of 37 weeks for both individuals combined.\n\nMost collective agreements provide for a paid parental allowance benefit to supplement unemployment insurance payments.\n\n5.6 Personal\n\n(Code 945)\n\nMost collective agreements provide up to two extended periods of leave without pay for personal reasons during an individual's career in the federal Public Service.\n\nIn most agreements this leave may be granted once for a period of up to three (3) months and once for a period of more than three (3) months but not exceeding one (1) year.\n\nThe granting of this leave is discretionary taking into consideration operational requirements.\n\nEmployees are not required to provide the reason for the leave request. This may be used for example by employees wishing to travel extensively or trying out a new job.\n\nNote: Employees should contact the Office of Integrity and Conflict Management in the Workplace to ensure there is no conflict of interest if pursing a new job opportunity.\n\nIn some Collective Agreements, the employee may take more than two periods of three months or less and two periods of more than three (3) months, with some stipulations with respect to the timing and frequency of this leave.\n\n34\n\n5.7 Reserve Forces Training / Military Leave (Code 650, 975 or 976)\n\nPersons appointed to the core public administration may be granted leave for other reasons for the purpose of serving in the Canadian Forces Reserve.\n\nIt is department's policy, following the lead of the Department of National Defence (DND), to encourage the granting this leave whenever possible.\n\nThe leave could be either with pay or without pay depending on circumstances.", "{'title': \"Manager's Leave Guide: Effective Decision-Making & Administration\", 'source_name': 'https://jusnet.justice.gc.ca/eng/benefit-avantage/doc/lgm-gcpg-eng.pdf', 'reference_url': 'https://jusnet.justice.gc.ca/eng/benefit-avantage/doc/lgm-gcpg-eng.pdf'}\nManagers are responsible for making decisions on leave requests in a timely manager. Leave requests are not to be unreasonably denied.\n\nManagers may only authorize leave to the extent that an employee has available credits.\n\nManagers are responsible for ensuring that employees who have insufficient sick leave credits to cover an absence due to illness are only granted sick leave with pay if the employee requests an advance of credits in writing and acknowledges the terms and conditions associated with that request. Approval of a request for advanced sick leave is to be made in writing and a copy provided to Compensation for audit purposes. Consultation with Labour Relations is recommended.\n\nIn considering requests for advanced sick leave which is repayable, managers must take into consideration an employee's ability to repay the credits.\n\nLeave requests which do not meet the conditions specified by the collective agreement or Terms and Conditions of Employment are to be denied.\n\nManagers have the responsibility to ensure that the leave they are authorizing is the appropriate type of leave in accordance with the collective agreement or Terms and Conditions of Employment BEFORE the leave is authorized.\n\n3.2.3.3 Discretion\n\nThe degree of discretion that managers have in approving or denying leave varies depending on the wording of specific leave articles, in accordance with the collective agreement or Terms and Conditions of Employment, as well as Departmental policies and/or practices. For example, managers can exercise a greater degree of discretion in granting personal or volunteer leave than they can in granting sick leave if employees satisfy the conditions of eligibility listed in the relevant collective agreement article or Terms and Conditions of Employment.\n\n3.2.3.4 Operational Requirements\n\nIn certain cases, the granting of leave is subject to operational requirements. When deciding whether or not to grant leave based on operational requirements, managers should consider each case in light of its particular circumstances. Managers need to demonstrate that the person's presence is necessary, and that the absence is not simply inconvenient.\n\n9\n\nThe needs of the organization must come first when considering an employee's request. Operational requirements must be based on the work to be performed and not on administrative or economic criteria. Managers are expected to plan work so that employees can take leave at times suitable to them.\n\n3.2.3.5 Prioritizing Requests\n\nAt certain times of the year, managers may be faced with several leave requests from different employees for the same period or day making it difficult to balance operational requirements. When the number of leave requests outweighs availability, managers will be required to exercise their discretion to determine the priority of selection based on a rationale that reflects a fair, transparent and equitable assessment of relevant circumstances.\n\nSome collective agreement specifies a delay for submission and approval of holidays as well as conditions to respect while approving them.\n\nIt is recommended to managers to consult the relevant collective agreement before approving any request.\n\nThe application of a blanket authority rule for everyone without considering the specific facts is an inappropriate use of discretion.\n\n3.2.3.6 Religious Observance\n\nThe Employer shall make every reasonable effort to accommodate an employee who requests time off to fulfill his/her religious obligations.\n\nAs per the Treasury Board Secretariat Directive on Leave and Special Working Arrangements, leave or flexible working arrangements should be provided to allow employees to meet their religious obligations.\n\nWhen approving leave for reasons of religious observance, persons with the delegated authority ensure, whenever operationally feasible, that appropriate arrangements are made for make-up time if requested, or for vacation or compensatory leave to be authorized.\n\n3.3 Advice and Guidance\n\nManagers shall direct their leave inquiries for interpretations of collective agreements to their Labour Relations Advisor.\n\nManagers should consult with their Labour Relations Advisor when extended leave without pay is being considered.\n\n10\n\nEmployees should consult their Compensation Advisor for the impact of leave without pay on their benefits.\n\n4.0 LEAVE WITH PAY\n\n4.1 Bereavement Leave (Code 510)\n\nIndeterminate employees, term employees of three (3) months or more and casual employees who have completed three months.\n\nThe intent is to allow an employee time off with pay for purposes related to the death in the immediate family, as defined in the relevant collective agreement or Terms and Conditions of Employment.\n\nManagement has the discretion to grant more leave in situations where it would be appropriate, for example in accordance with religious or cultural practices or in situations where the distance the employee has to travel justifies additional leave.\n\nAn employee's requirement for bereavement leave varies depending on personal circumstances therefore each request should be considered on a case by case basis.\n\nThe maximum duration of this leave is calculated in calendar days (including weekends and statutory holidays) but is reported in hours for any working days within the period.\n\nThe leave request should indicate in the comments section the family relationship of the deceased to the employee (examples: mother, father, brother, sister etc.). Where the request includes an extension for travel, the location of the funeral should also be indicated in the remarks.", "{'title': \"Manager's Leave Guide: Effective Decision-Making & Administration\", 'source_name': 'https://jusnet.justice.gc.ca/eng/benefit-avantage/doc/lgm-gcpg-eng.pdf', 'reference_url': 'https://jusnet.justice.gc.ca/eng/benefit-avantage/doc/lgm-gcpg-eng.pdf'}\nCollective agreements and Terms and Conditions of Employment provide for a variety of leave without pay types from which employees may benefit provided they meet the conditions for applying.\n\n29\n\nAlthough leave without pay means that an employee is without a salary, both employees and managers should understand that leave without pay is not without a cost to both the employee and the employer.\n\nWhile an employee is on leave without pay, depending on the leave type and duration, accrual of pensionable service for which contributions are required continues during leave without pay. Even if an employee pays the full share of contributions for a period of leave without pay, the eventual pension benefits paid out at retirement will exceed the amount of contributions paid for the leave without pay. This represents a future liability to the employer.\n\nAdditionally, employees continue to enjoy coverage for disability insurance and supplementary death benefit coverage during leave without pay. Also, based on options, employees may continue coverage under the Dental Care plan and the Public Service Health Care Plan.\n\nPrior to applying for leave without pay, employees should always take the time to consult Compensation Services to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of leave without pay on benefits.\n\nEmployees and managers should also understand that leave without pay impacts benefits in various ways.\n\n5.1 Care of Immediate Family (also known as Leave Without Pay for Long-term Care of a Parent) (Code 952)\n\nThis leave is intended for the care of family members; family is described in the relevant collective agreement or Terms and Conditions of Employment.\n\nIt is important for managers to reference the article of the collective agreement or Terms and Conditions as the language from one article to another is not standard.\n\nCare of family has not been defined and therefore could include a variety of different situations.\n\nLeave has to be for a minimum period of three (3) weeks and in most collective agreements there is a maximum period of five (5) years during the total period of employment in the Public Service. Consult the applicable collective agreement for further information.\n\nThe employee must notify his/her supervisor at least four (4) weeks in advance before taking this leave.\n\n30\n\nIf the employee satisfies the requirements of the article, the leave must be approved. 5.1.2 Compassionate Care (Code 952)\n\nCompassionate Care leave is a sub-set of Care of Immediate Family provisions of most collective agreements. Entitlement to this leave is typically linked to eligibility for Compassionate Care Benefits under the Employment Insurance (EI) program.\n\n\"Compassionate care benefits are Employment Insurance (El) benefits paid to people who have to be away from work temporarily to provide care or support to a family member who is gravely ill and who has a significant risk of death within 26 weeks (six months). A maximum of six weeks of compassionate care benefits may be paid to eligible people.\" (source: El web site)\n\nThe duration of this leave may vary from one collective agreement to another. Some agreements tie the limit to the number of weeks of eligibility to the EI benefits while others prescribe a set number of weeks as the limit. Please refer to the collective agreement for limitations to the duration of this leave.\n\nWhere the collective agreement indicates, evidence of entitlement to EI Compassionate Care benefits must be supplied to the manager.\n\nWhere enabling language for Compassionate Care Leave does not exist in the relevant collective agreement, Leave without Pay For Other Reasons may be granted.\n\n5.2 Educational Leave (Code 915)\n\nEducational Leave without pay may be granted for varying periods of up to one (1) year, which can be renewed by mutual agreement to attend a recognized institution for studies in some field of education which is beneficial to both the employee and the organization.\n\nThe training is employee-requested and at the Manager's discretion.\n\nDepending on the collective agreement, employees may receive an allowance of up to 100% of salary (not including bilingual bonus) associated with this type of leave\n\n31\n\ndepending on the degree to which the education leave is deemed by the Employer to be relevant to organizational requirements.\n\nThis leave may be appropriate where efforts to recruit in a particular skill shortage area have not been productive; where a skill shortage will exist in the future; where it is not feasible to satisfy the skill requirement through the staffing process; or where the period of training is lengthy, usually requiring full-time attendance.\n\nManagers should ensure that they have the proper delegation of authority to approve this leave, as the delegation for approval authority for the leave and the allowances is very limited.\n\n5.3 Maternity Leave\n\n(Code 925)\n\nPregnant employees subject to a collective agreement or terms and conditions of employment are eligible to apply for this leave. Casuals and Students are not eligible.\n\nThe collective agreement or terms and conditions of employment should be examined as some stipulate a minimum period of employment to qualify for maternity leave.\n\nThis leave provides leave without pay to female employees before, on or after the termination date of the pregnancy. It is unpaid leave granted for the purpose of dealing with the pregnancy, delivery, and care of her new-born child."], "faithfulness": 1.0, "correctness": 0.875, "p_sources_found": 1.0, "mostly_correct": true, "any_sources_found": true}]
